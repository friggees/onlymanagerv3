# Project Development Updates

This document tracks the progress made on the OnlyManager backend development.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and User Management

### 1. Initial Project Understanding
- Reviewed `docs/project.md` to understand the core requirements for the economy module and related backend functionalities.

### 2. Core Database Schema Implementation
The following tables were created in the `public` schema using Supabase migrations:

- **`user_profiles`**:
    - Stores additional information for users, linking to `auth.users`.
    - Includes `id` (UUID, FK to `auth.users`), `full_name` (TEXT), `role` (TEXT CHECK ('owner', 'manager', 'chatter', 'model')), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - A `handle_new_user()` PL/pgSQL function was created to facilitate populating this table (initial trigger on `auth.users` was removed due to permission constraints).
    - **Update**: Added `telegram_username` (TEXT NULL) and `contract_document_path` (TEXT NULL) columns.
- **`models`**:
    - Stores information specific to OnlyFans models.
    - Includes `id` (UUID, PK), `user_id` (UUID, FK to `user_profiles`, UNIQUE, optional), `name` (TEXT), `platform_fee_percentage` (DECIMAL, default 20%), `split_chatting_costs` (BOOLEAN, default FALSE), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - Includes a trigger (`before_insert_or_update_models`) to ensure `user_id` (if set) references a user with the 'model' role.
- **`user_model_assignments`**:
    - Links users (chatters, managers) to models in a many-to-many relationship.
    - Includes `user_id` (UUID, FK to `user_profiles`), `model_id` (UUID, FK to `models`), `assigned_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ).
    - Primary Key: (`user_id`, `model_id`).
    - Indexed on `model_id` and `user_id`.
- **`user_financial_settings`**:
    - Stores financial configurations for users.
    - Includes `user_id` (UUID, PK, FK to `user_profiles`), `commission_percentage` (DECIMAL), `fixed_salary_amount` (DECIMAL), `salary_type` (ENUM `salary_structure_type`: 'commission_only', 'fixed_only', 'fixed_plus_commission', 'passive_tick_only'), `manager_passive_tick_percentage` (DECIMAL), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - Includes a CHECK constraint (`check_financial_settings_consistency`) for data integrity based on `salary_type`.
- **`platform_settings`**:
    - Singleton table for global platform configurations.
    - Includes `id` (INT, PK, DEFAULT 1, CHECK (id=1)), `default_platform_fee_percentage` (DECIMAL, default 20%), `currency_symbol` (TEXT, default '$'), `currency_code` (TEXT, default 'USD'), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - Default row inserted on creation.
    - Trigger (`on_platform_settings_update`) to update `updated_at`.
- **`model_specific_settings`**:
    - Allows overriding global settings for individual models.
    - Includes `model_id` (UUID, PK, FK to `models`), `platform_fee_percentage` (DECIMAL, optional override), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
    - Trigger (`on_model_specific_settings_update`) to update `updated_at`.

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation
- RLS was enabled on all newly created tables listed above.
- Specific RLS policies were applied to each table to control access based on user roles (`owner`, `manager`, `chatter`, `model`) and relationships (e.g., users viewing their own data, managers viewing data of assigned models/users). Policies cover SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations as appropriate for each role and table.

### 4. Verification and Setup
- **Table Confirmation**: Used `list_tables` MCP tool to confirm the creation of all schema tables.
- **RLS Policy Testing**: Discussed limitations of `execute_sql` for direct RLS context testing. Full runtime RLS verification is recommended via Supabase client libraries with authenticated test users.
- **TypeScript Types**: Generated TypeScript definitions for the database schema using the `generate_typescript_types` MCP tool.
- **Saved Types**: The generated types were saved to `src/types/supabase.ts`. (Regenerated after adding new columns to `user_profiles`).
- **Test User Profiles**: Inserted initial records into `public.user_profiles` for test users with roles 'owner', 'model', 'manager', and 'chatter' using provided UUIDs:
    - `5d6275c2-5a30-4f56-b71a-ef82370caf95` as `owner`
    - `53566d3b-8480-4393-b1ff-8f30dab87a73` as `model`
    - `34076ddf-948b-4629-a35d-b7b42d2c9618` as `manager`
    - `d901a1e8-3695-4101-96a1-110f80315402` as `chatter`
- **Test Model Records**: During RLS testing, the following model records were created and used as persistent test data in the `public.models` table:
    - `df0786f1-f61c-4e0e-847d-dd777b62a230` (initially named "Model A", linked to `user_id: 53566d3b-8480-4393-b1ff-8f30dab87a73`. Name was later updated during testing to "Model A Self-Updated Name"). This corresponds to `model_A_record_id` in test cases.
    - `a6e4251e-64b6-44e2-9eff-a6a7b636d7e4` (named "Model B", no linked `user_id`). This corresponds to `model_B_record_id` in test cases.
    - Other temporary model records created during specific test steps (e.g., "Model C, D, E") were deleted during the test flow.

This completes the foundational setup for user management and core settings, including necessary test data.

## Phase 2: RLS Policy Hardening

### 5. RLS Policy Testing and Analysis
- **Comprehensive RLS Testing**: Executed a detailed set of test cases (outlined in `docs/rls_test_cases.md`) for all core tables (`user_profiles`, `models`, `user_model_assignments`, `user_financial_settings`, `platform_settings`, `model_specific_settings`) across all defined user roles (owner, manager, chatter, model).
- **Vulnerability Identification**: The testing revealed numerous critical and major vulnerabilities where existing RLS policies were overly permissive, allowing users to access or modify data beyond their intended scope.
    - For example, non-owner roles could often view data they shouldn't, update fields they shouldn't (like their own role or sensitive settings), or delete records they shouldn't.
    - Even owners could delete the singleton row in `platform_settings`.
- **Detailed Report**: A comprehensive report of these findings and initial recommendations was documented in `docs/rls_test_results.md`.

### 6. RLS Policy Revision and Application
- **Iterative Revisions**: Based on the test results and Supabase documentation (via Context7), RLS policies for all affected tables were iteratively revised and applied via Supabase migrations.
    - **`user_profiles`**: Policies were updated (migration `revise_user_profiles_rls_policies_v14_user_provided_fix`) to refine SELECT permissions and restrict INSERT/DELETE operations to owners. UPDATE policies for non-owners were adjusted to allow self-updates while attempting to prevent role changes using `WITH CHECK (... AND role = 'their_actual_role')`. A helper function `get_user_role(UUID)` was introduced.
    - **`models`**: Policies updated (migration `revise_models_rls_policies_v1_reapply`) to restrict SELECT for non-owners to assigned/owned models and disallow write operations, except for Model Users updating their own model record (currently all fields).
    - **`user_model_assignments`**: Policies updated (migration `revise_user_model_assignments_rls_v1_reapply`) to scope SELECTs appropriately and disallow write operations for non-owners.
    - **`user_financial_settings`**: Policies updated (migration `revise_user_financial_settings_rls_v1_reapply`) to scope SELECTs appropriately and disallow write operations for non-owners.
    - **`platform_settings`**: Policies updated (migration `revise_platform_settings_rls_v1_reapply`) to allow SELECT for all, UPDATE for owners only, and prevent INSERT/DELETE for all (protecting the singleton).
    - **`model_specific_settings`**: Policies updated (migration `revise_model_specific_settings_rls_v1_reapply`) to scope SELECTs appropriately and disallow write operations for non-owners.
- **Outstanding Concerns Noted**: The `docs/rls_test_results.md` file was updated to include a "Post-Revision Testing and Outstanding Concerns" section. This highlights:
    - The need to re-test the `user_profiles` update policy's effectiveness in preventing self-role changes by non-owners due to previous parser issues with `NEW`/`OLD` constructs.
    - The need to address potential overly permissive updates by Model Users on sensitive fields in their own `models` record (e.g., `platform_fee_percentage`), possibly requiring triggers if RLS column-specific checks remain problematic.
    - A general recommendation for a full re-run of all test cases.
    - Monitoring performance of the `get_user_role` function.

The RLS policies are now in a significantly more secure state, though specific areas require further verification and potentially alternative enforcement mechanisms (like triggers) for complete robustness.

## Phase 3: Security Hardening with Database Triggers

### 7. Verification of Outstanding RLS Concerns
- **Targeted Testing**: Executed tests specifically for the "Post-Revision Testing and Outstanding Concerns" section of `docs/rls_test_results.md`.
- **Vulnerabilities Confirmed**:
    - **Self-Role Escalation (CRITICAL)**: Tests confirmed that Manager, Chatter, and Model Users could indeed change their own `role` in the `user_profiles` table to 'owner'. The existing RLS `WITH CHECK` conditions were ineffective.
    - **Unauthorized Financial Control by Model Users (HIGH)**: Tests confirmed that Model Users could update sensitive financial fields (`platform_fee_percentage`, `split_chatting_costs`) on their own `models` record, in addition to non-sensitive fields like `name`. The RLS policy was too permissive.

### 8. Implementation of Database Trigger Solutions
Based on the confirmed vulnerabilities and recommended solutions, database triggers were implemented as a more robust fix:

- **`user_profiles` - Role Escalation Prevention**:
    - **Migration**: `create_trigger_prevent_self_role_escalation`
    - **Action**: Created the `public.prevent_role_escalation()` PL/pgSQL function and the `user_profiles_role_protection` `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on `public.user_profiles`.
    - **Logic**: This trigger checks if a user's role is being changed. If so, it ensures the acting user (identified by `auth.jwt() ->> 'role'`) is an 'owner'. It also explicitly prevents escalation to the 'owner' role by non-owners. *Note: This trigger still allows an owner to change any role, including their own, to something else. A strict interpretation of "owners should not be able to change their own role" might require adjusting this trigger to prevent an owner from changing their *own* role specifically.*
- **`models` - Sensitive Financial Field Update Restriction**:
    - **Migration**: `create_trigger_restrict_model_financial_updates`
    - **Action**: Created the `public.restrict_model_financial_updates()` PL/pgSQL function and the `models_financial_protection` `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger on `public.models`.
    - **Logic**: This trigger checks if `platform_fee_percentage` or `split_chatting_costs` are being changed. If so, it ensures the acting user (identified by `auth.jwt() ->> 'role'`) is an 'owner'.

### 9. Verification of Trigger-Based Fixes
- **Self-Role Escalation Fix Verification**:
    - Re-tested attempts by Manager, Chatter, and Model Users (with appropriate JWT `role` claims set) to update their own `role` to 'owner'.
    - **Result**: All attempts were **successfully blocked** by the `user_profiles_role_protection` trigger.
- **Sensitive Financial Field Update Fix Verification**:
    - Re-tested attempts by a Model User (with JWT `role` claim 'model') to update fields on their own `models` record:
        - Update `name` (non-sensitive): **Successful**.
        - Update `platform_fee_percentage` (sensitive): **Successfully blocked**.
        - Update `split_chatting_costs` (sensitive): **Successfully blocked**.
    - These vulnerabilities are now resolved.

## Phase 4: Deep Dive into `user_profiles` RLS SELECT Behavior (Manager Context)

Date: 2025-05-23 to 2025-05-24

### 10. Initial RLS Policy (v3) for Manager SELECT and Testing
- **Policy v3 Applied**: The `user_profiles_select_policy` (migration `revise_user_profiles_select_for_managers_v3`) was applied. This policy aimed to allow managers to see their own profile, profiles of users assigned to their managed models, and profiles of models they manage (if the model itself has a user profile), while excluding owners.
- **Testing (Manager `34076ddf-948b-4629-a35d-b7b42d2c9618`):**
    - Test 1.2.1 (Own Profile): PASS
    - Test 1.2.2 (Managed Chatter A): PASS
    - Test 1.2.3 (Managed Model A): PASS
    - Test 1.2.4 (Owner Profile - should fail): **FAIL** (Owner profile was visible)
    - Test 1.2.5 (Unrelated Chatter B - should fail): Initially failed due to user creation issue. After using an existing unrelated user (`eff7ebc0-ef87-404b-81f3-a9c87f03afce`), this test **PASSED** (0 rows returned).
- **Policy v3 Flaw**: The subquery `(SELECT role FROM public.user_profiles WHERE user_profiles.id = user_profiles.id) <> 'owner'` was identified as incorrect.

### 11. Policy Revision (v4) and Continued `auth.uid()` Investigation
- **Policy v4 Applied**: Corrected the owner exclusion to `AND id NOT IN (SELECT up.id FROM public.user_profiles up WHERE up.role = 'owner')`.
- **Test 1.2.4 (Owner Profile with v4)**: **Still FAILED** (Owner profile visible to manager).
- **`set_config` Investigation**:
    - Suspected issues with `set_config('request.jwt.claims', '{"sub": "UUID", "role": "authenticated"}', ...)` not correctly setting context for `auth.uid()`.
    - User's manual tests confirmed that `auth.uid()` was `NULL` after using `set_config('request.jwt.claims', ...)` in separate SQL Editor commands.
- **Breakthrough with `request.jwt.claim.sub`**:
    - The `auth.uid()` function definition checks `request.jwt.claim.sub` first.
    - A combined query test (`WITH set_guc AS (SELECT set_config('request.jwt.claim.sub', 'UUID', false)) SELECT auth.uid() FROM set_guc;`) via `execute_sql` **successfully resolved `auth.uid()`**.
    - This indicated that `set_config('request.jwt.claim.sub', 'UUID', ...)` is the correct GUC to target, and combining `set_config` with the main query in a single execution is crucial for the `execute_sql` tool.

### 12. Testing with Corrected `auth.uid()` Simulation and RLS Bypass Discovery
- **Policy v4 Re-Tested (Manager, combined query with `request.jwt.claim.sub`)**: Test 1.2.4 (Owner Profile) **still FAILED**. Manager could see the owner.
- **`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`**: Applied `ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`.
- **Re-Test (Manager, combined, RLS Forced)**: Test 1.2.4 **still FAILED**.
- **Connection User Investigation**:
    - `execute_sql` connects as user `postgres`.
    - This `postgres` user has `rolsuper = false` but is the `tableowner` of `user_profiles`.
    - With `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, this table owner *should* be subject to RLS.
- **Conflicting Policy Check**:
    - Identified an `ALL` command policy "Owners can manage all user profiles" on `roles: {public}`.
    - This policy was `DROP`ped to isolate the primary SELECT policy.
- **Re-Test (Manager, combined, RLS Forced, broad policy dropped)**: Test 1.2.4 **still FAILED**. Manager could see all 6 profiles.
- **Final "Owner-Only" Policy**:
    - A very restrictive policy `user_profiles_owner_only_select_policy` (`USING ((SELECT role FROM public.user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'owner')`) was applied as the sole SELECT policy.
    - Tested as Manager (combined query, RLS Forced): **Still FAILED** (Manager saw all 6 profiles).

### 13. Conclusion on `user_profiles` RLS SELECT Testing via `execute_sql`
- **RLS Bypass by `postgres` User**: The consistent failure of restrictive RLS SELECT policies to hide rows from the simulated Manager (when `execute_sql` connects as `postgres`) strongly indicates that this `postgres` user session, as utilized by the `execute_sql` tool, bypasses RLS for `SELECT` operations on tables it owns, despite `rolsuper=false` and `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. This might be due to inherent privileges of the `postgres` user in Supabase or specific session characteristics of the MCP tool's connection.
- **Policy Correctness vs. Test Environment Limitation**:
    - The final "owner-only" SELECT policy (`user_profiles_owner_only_select_policy`) is logically correct for the simplified requirement that only owners should read `user_profiles`.
    - The inability to verify this restriction using `execute_sql` is a limitation of the testing environment, not necessarily a flaw in the policy itself for a true application context.
- **Recommendation**:
    1.  Maintain the `user_profiles_owner_only_select_policy` and `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on `user_profiles`.
    2.  Acknowledge that `execute_sql` (as `postgres`) is not suitable for verifying restrictive `SELECT` RLS on tables owned by `postgres`.
    3.  True RLS verification for non-owner roles on `user_profiles` (and other tables) will require testing through the application with actual user JWTs or manual testing with a less-privileged database role.
    4.  Proceed with RLS design for other core business tables, keeping this testing insight in mind.

*Important note: The trigger `prevent_role_escalation` currently allows an owner to change their own role. If the requirement is that owners should *never* be able to change their own role, this trigger would need adjustment.*
